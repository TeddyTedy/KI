## Problem description

- The goal of the player is to traverse the two-dimensional, moving labyrinth from its starting to position to a defined goal position
- There are a different types of tiles if different access towards other tiles, specifying which surrounding tiles the player is able to reach.
- Additionally, there is one free tile which can be inserted at predefined positions, altering the labyrinth and potentially even the position of the player if he stands on a labyrinth tile that is affected
- if the player is pushed out of the labyrinth, he immediately is set at the position of the tile which insertion has pushed him out
- The goal is to reach the goal destination with minimal cost, every tile insertion costs one unit while player movements are free from any costs
